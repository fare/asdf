        <h3>ASDF 3</h3>
        <p>ASDF 3 is the current successor to Daniel Barlow's ASDF.
          It was rewritten for improved portability, robustness, usability,
          extensibility, configurability, internal consistency,
          and the ability to deliver standalone executables.
          Its notable versions include pre-release 2.27 on February 1st 2013,
          first stable release 3.0.1 on May 16th 2013,
          major release 3.1.2 on May 6th 2014,
          and latest release 3.1.5 on July 21st 2015.
        </p>
        <a id="what_it_is"></a>
        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <p>ASDF stands for <em>A</em>nother <em>S</em>ystem <em>D</em>efinition <em>F</em>acility,
          the successor of the Lisp <tt>DEFSYSTEM</tt> of yore.
        </p>
        <p>ASDF 3 contains two parts: <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt> and <tt>uiop</tt>.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><tt>asdf/defsystem</tt></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>is a tool to describe how Lisp source code is organized in systems,
              and how to build a system in term of actions that depend on previous actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typical actions consist in compiling a Lisp source file (if not up to date)
              and loading the resulting compilation output (if not both loaded and up to date).
              And you must typically compile and load files that define packages, macros, variables,
              before you may compile and load other files that use them.
            </p>
            <p>ASDF is what Common Lisp hackers use to build and load software,
              where C hackers might use GNU <tt>Make</tt> to build software and
              <tt>ld.so</tt> to load it.
            </p>
            <p><tt>asdf/defsystem</tt> is the part that people usually refer to as <tt>ASDF</tt>,
              with <tt>uiop</tt> being only a supporting library,
              that happens to be distributed at the same time, by necessity.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt><tt>uiop</tt></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>also known as <tt>asdf/driver</tt>,
              the Utilities for Implementation- and OS- Portability,
              is a Common Lisp portability library and runtime support system
              that helps you write Common Lisp software in a portable way.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to many general-purpose Lisp utilities,
              it notably provides portable abstractions to
              gloss over implementation quirks, support hot-upgrade of code,
              manipulate pathnames, create programs, use command-line arguments,
              access the environment, use the filesystem,
              call other programs and parse their output,
              compile Lisp code, muffle conditions, or configure Lisp software.
              See its
              <a href="https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf/blob/master/uiop/README.md">README.md</a> for an overview,
              and the documentation as extracted from its docstrings by
              <a href="http://bimib.disco.unimib.it/people/Marco.Antoniotti/Projects/CL/HELAMBDAP/tests/asdf-uiop/docs/html/dictionary/dictionary.html">HEΛP</a>
              (beware: you can, though it's not obvious, scroll the list of packages
              with a scrollbar on the right of the top-left pane, and then click on the package
              you're interested in to browse its symbols).
            </p>
            <p><tt>uiop</tt> is distributed as part of the <tt>ASDF</tt>,
              its source code is transcluded in the single-file <tt>asdf.lisp</tt> being distributed
              and the precompiled fasls provided by Lisp implementations.
              <tt>ASDF</tt> relies heavily on it for its portability layer and runtime support,
              particularly so as to handle pathnames and filesystem access.
              <tt>uiop</tt> is useful on its own and can also be compiled and distributed separately.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <a id="what_it_is_not"></a>
        <h3>What it is not</h3>
        <p>ASDF will <em>not</em> download missing software components for you.
          For that, you want <a href="http://quicklisp.org/"><tt>Quicklisp</tt></a>,
          that builds upon ASDF, and is great for pulling and installing
          tarballs of packages you may depend upon;
          we also recommend <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/"><tt>clbuild</tt></a>,
          that now builds upon Quicklisp, as a great tool for pulling from version control
          packages you need to modify or want to contribute to.
          We recommend you should <em>not</em> use <tt>asdf-install</tt> anymore,
          as it is an older similar piece of software that is both unmaintained and obsolete.
        </p><p>
          ASDF is also not a tool to build or run Common Lisp software from the Unix command-line.
          For that, you want <a href="http://cliki.net/cl-launch">cl-launch</a>,
          or perhaps <a href="http://www.xach.com/lisp/buildapp/">buildapp</a>.
        </p><p>
          If you're unsatisfied with ASDF,
          beside helping with our
          <a href="https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf/blob/master/TODO">TODO list</a>,
          you might be interested in other build systems for Common-Lisp:
          <ul>
            <li>Alastair Bridgewater's small and simple one-package-per-file
              <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/asdf/+bug/1230368"><tt>quick-build</tt></a>
              (also reimplemented as the ASDF extension
              <a href="https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf-package-system"
                 ><tt>asdf-package-system</tt></a>, now part of ASDF 3;
              similar to <tt>faslpath</tt> below).
            </li>
            <li>Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau's
              <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/xcvb/"><tt>XCVB</tt></a>
              (building object and image files deterministically and in parallel,
              but not actively maintained since 2012;
              a hypothetical ASDF 4 could conceivably be evolved to support these features
              thanks to the groundwork laid by ASDF 3).
            </li>
            <li>Drew McDermott's
              <a href="http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dvm/"><tt>YTools</tt></a>
              (the polar opposite, trying to maintain coherence
              of the current Lisp image at a fine grain).
            </li>
            <li>Dmitriy Ivanov's
              <a href="http://lisp.ystok.ru/asdlite/"><tt>ASDlite</tt></a>
              (a somewhat improved incompatible variant of ASDF 1, less featureful than ASDF 3),
            </li>
            <li>Mark Kantrowitz's
              <a href="http://www.cliki.net/mk-defsystem"><tt>mk-defsystem</tt></a>
              (free software successor of the old proprietary DEFSYSTEM's
              and predecessor of ASDF, obsolete),
            </li>
            <li>Sean Ross's
              <a href="http://sean-ross.blogspot.com/search/label/mudballs"><tt>mudballs</tt></a>
              (an attempt at making things cleaner than in ASDF 2, aborted),
            </li>
            <li>Peter von Etter's
              <a href="http://www.cliki.net/faslpath"><tt>faslpath</tt></a>
              (a much simpler system establishing a mapping between packages and files,
              abandoned but see <tt>asdf-package-system</tt> and <tt>quick-build</tt> above).
            </li>
            <li>Alexander Kahl's
              <a href="http://www.cliki.net/evol"><tt>evol</tt></a>
              (a reimplementation in Lisp of the GNU autotools stack, abandoned),
            </li>
          </ul>
          There are probably more.
          However, none of these systems seems to ever have had the traction of ASDF,
          probably because none was technically superior enough (when at all)
          to compensate for the first mover advantage.
        </p>
        <h3>Supported Implementations</h3>
        <p>ASDF 3 now supports all CL implementations
          that seem to have any current user base, and then some.
        </p><p>
          Most implementations provide ASDF as a module,
          and you can simply <tt>(require "asdf")</tt>.
          (All of them but CLISP also accept
          <tt>:asdf</tt>, <tt>"ASDF"</tt> or <tt>'asdf</tt> as an argument.)
          Most of these implementations provide ASDF 3.
          Some implementations don't provide ASDF 3 yet,
          but have announced they will in their next release.
          As for remaining implementations,
          they are obsolete and/or mostly unmaintained.
        </p>

        </table>
        <p>
          To deal with an old implementation that didn't yet provide ASDF 3,
          we provide <a href="https://common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf/blob/master/tools/install-asdf.lisp">a script</a>
          that can install ASDF 3 where your implementation goes looking for it
          when you <tt>(require "asdf")</tt> .
        </p><p>
          Note that upgrading from an old version of ASDF is possible,
          but quite complex to do right in a robust way, and we do not recommend it.
          Also note that <tt>mocl</tt> only supports a heavily modified variant of ASDF 2,
          and will require robust cross-compilation support to be added to ASDF 3
          before it is actually supported.
        </p>

        <p>Until we write more documentation on the further innovations of ASDF 3,
          the documentation strings, the source code, the changelog and the git log
          are unfortunately your best chances for discovering the available functionality.

            including support for automatically detecting constants from C macros,
            linking to dynamic libraries, and writing your own wrapper code in C.</li>
          <li><a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/qitab/"
                 ><tt>poiu</tt></a>,
            to compile a system in parallel on a multiprocessor machine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Former extensions, now superseded, include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><tt>asdf-binary-locations</tt>
            used to allow one to redirect where ASDF 1 created its output files,
            so they don't clash between implementations and don't pollute source directories.
            It is superseded by <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt>'s builtin
            <tt>asdf-output-translations</tt> mechanism;
            a limited compatibility mode is available to easily convert
            your former ABL configuration into an AOT configuration.
            <tt>common-lisp-controller</tt> and <tt>cl-launch</tt>
            used to provide similar mechanisms,
            and have also been superseded by <tt>asdf-output-translations</tt>
            (built into ASDF 2 and later).
          </li>
          <li><tt>asdf-bundle</tt>, n&eacute;e <tt>asdf-ecl</tt>,
            allowed you to create a single-file bundle out of a system,
            for easier delivery.
            It is now a builtin part of <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt>,
            and allows users to deliver a single FASL for a system,
            a standalone executable program (on supported implementations),
            or an image containing your system precompiled.
          </li>
          <li><tt>asdf-condition-control</tt>, initially part of XCVB's <tt>xcvb-driver</tt>,
            allowed you to muffle uninteresting conditions during compilation.
            Is now superseded by equivalent functionality in <tt>uiop</tt>.
          </li>
          <li><a href="https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf-contrib"
                 ><tt>asdf-contrib</tt></a>,
            an empty package that used to collect dependencies on other systems
            in the list above and below.</li>
          <li><a href="http://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf-package-system"
                 ><tt>asdf-package-system</tt></a>,
            to compile Lisp source files with one package per file
            that also determines dependencies, in the style of
            <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/asdf/+bug/1230368"><tt>quick-build</tt></a> or
            <a href="http://www.cliki.net/faslpath"><tt>faslpath</tt></a>
            (this functionality is built into recent versions of ASDF 3.1 and later,
            but this package exists for backward compatibility with earlier versions of ASDF 3;
            search the manual for <tt>package-inferred-system</tt>).
          </li>
          <li><tt>asdf-utils</tt> was a collection of utilities that originated with ASDF.
            It is now superseded by <tt>uiop</tt>, aka <tt>asdf/driver</tt>,
            which is part of ASDF,
            and exports its functionality
            in its own package <tt>uiop</tt>.

        <h3>What is happening</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>July 2015</dt>
          <dd>An extensive bout of bug-fixing, notably on Windows, leads to
        release of ASDF 3.1.5 on 21 July 2015. XDG handling has been improved to
        be more compliant with the standard. <em>Preliminary</em> support for
        immutable systems has been added.</dd>
          <dt>May 2015</dt>
          <dd>With the LispWorks 7.0 release, all actively maintained CL implementations
        are now providing ASDF 3.0 or later, and
        support for older variants is now officially dropped.</dd>
          <dt>October 2014</dt>
          <dd>More bug fixing leads to release of 3.1.4 on 10 October 2014.
          There should be no incompatibilities.
          See the <a href="changelog">Changelog</a> for more details.</dd>
          <dt>August 2014</dt>
          <dd>The ASDF mailing lists have been reestablished, in particular
        asdf-announce, which should allow CL implementers better access to only
        the information they want about ASDF development.</dd>
          <dt>May 2014 to July 2014</dt>
          <dd>ASDF bug fixing from 3.1.2 leads to release of 3.1.3, a major bug
        fix release.  We strongly urge implementors that have shipped with 3.1.2
        to upgrade to 3.1.3. There should be no incompatibilities, and some
        very important bug fixes are provided. See the Changelog for more details.</dd>
          <dt>July 2013 to May 2014</dt>
          <dd>Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau has resigned as maintainer
            but remained an active developer.
            Robert P. Goldman is interim maintainer until someone more gifted,
            charming, dedicated, and better-looking can be secured to fill the role.
            ASDF 3.0.2 was released in July 2013, 3.0.3 in October 2013, and 3.1.2 in May 2014.
            In addition to significant improvements and bug fixes,
            notably better Windows support,
            ASDF 3.1.2 notably sports the <tt>package-inferred-system</tt> extension.
          </dd>
          <dt>November 2012 to June 2013</dt>
          <dd>
            Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau completely rewrites ASDF
            and publishes ASDF 3, pre-released as 2.27 in February 2013,
            and released as 3.0.1 in May 2013.
            It now includes both the traditional <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt>
            and a formalized portability library <tt>uiop</tt> (n&eacute;e <tt>asdf/driver</tt>).
            <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt> is a backward-compatible reimplementation of ASDF
            with correct timestamp propagation based on a consistent dependency model,
            and featuring support for bundle output, deferred warnings check, and more.
            <tt>uiop</tt> provides many abstractions to write portable Common Lisp programs.
            Last version: 3.0.1.
          </dd>
          <dt>December 2009 to October 2012</dt>
          <dd>Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau is de facto maintainer,
            with notable contributions from Robert P. Goldman, but also
            Juanjo Garcia-Ripoll and James Anderson.
            ASDF 2.000 is released in May 2010
            with many clean-ups, better configurability, some new features,
            and updated documentation.
            The ASDF 2 series culminates with ASDF 2.26 in October 2012,
            which in addition to many bug fixes and small features
            includes support for file encodings, around-compile and compile-check hooks.
            Last version: 2.26.
          </dd>
          <dt>May 2006 to November 2009</dt>
          <dd>Gary King is de facto maintainer,
            with notable contributions from
            Robert P. Goldman, Nikodemus Siivola, Christophe Rhodes, Daniel Herring.
            Many small features and bug fixes,
            making the project more maintainable,
            moving to using git and common-lisp.net.
            Last version: 1.369.
          </dd>
          <dt>May 2004 to April 2006</dt>
          <dd>Christophe Rhodes is de facto maintainer,
            with notable contributions from
            Nikodemus Siivola, Peter Van Eynde, Edi Weitz, Kevin Rosenberg.
            The system made slightly more robust, a few more features.
            Last version: 1.97.
          </dd>
          <dt>August 2001 to May 2004</dt>
          <dd>Created then developed by Daniel Barlow, with notable contributions from
            Christophe Rhodes, Kevin Rosenberg, Edi Weitz, Rahul Jain.
